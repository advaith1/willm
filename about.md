# About

Will's Inventory (willm.ga) is a site to store my projects, art, and more! :) I want you to see the things that I'm working on!
   If you wanna get your art featured on the [Art page](art), email [art@willm.ga](mailto:art@willm.ga).


Anyways, Will's Inventory started development on Jan 18, 2018 - *on going*! Let me and Advaith know your site feedback at `feedback@willm.ga`
